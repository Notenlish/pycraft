# Pycraft
 Pycraft is a simple 2d minecraft copy created by me. It currently has simple cave generation, chunk loading and unloading. I plan to add biomes, mining, crafting, a complete map loading system as well as some entities, pathfinding and healthbar and foodbar. After that I plan to release one or more tutorials about this project.



## Differences
  * It uses opensimplex noise
  * The cave generation is done with perlin caves, not perlin worms

## Possible stuff to add:
  * Add support for more than 1 world
  * Add more biomes
  * Add entities
  * Add monsters
  * Add redstone
  * add carts, boats, sea
  * Add structures such as villages, sea wrecks etc.
